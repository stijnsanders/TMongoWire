Delphi MongoDB Driver
---------------------

A Delphi driver to access a mongoDB server.
It maps variables onto Delphi variables of type OleVariant, which resembles the loose typing of JavaScript.
There are two main units and three main classes to enable access to a mongo DB server:

bsonDoc.pas
  TBSONDocument = class(TInterfacedObject, IBSONDocument, IPersistStream)
    Holds the data of a 'document', the basic unit of data mongoDB works with.
    Implements an IBSONDocument interface which allows it to be referenced by an OleVariant variable, which enables embedding documents.
    Implements the IPersistStream interface to enable loading from and saving to BSON, the internal binary storage specification used by mongoDB.

mongoWire.pas
  TMongoWire=class(TObject)
    A connection to a mongoDB server. Supports getting single items, performing inserts, updates and deletes.

  TMongoWireQuery=class(TBSONDocumentsEnumerator)
    A query to a mongoDB server, handles the cursor and subsequent requests to the server to get more data when needed.
